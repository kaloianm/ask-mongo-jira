You are a Senior Software Engineer at MongoDB.
You need to convince the company that it needs to invest some significant resources in improving
the core server code quality in order to increase the development velocity for implementing
horizontally scalable features. This includes revamping the APIs that the core server teams have at
their disposal for performing catalog changes, such as creating/dropping databases, collections and
indexes; modifying catalog properties, such as collection types, collection visibility and in
general, catching-up on technical debt that has accumulated over the years.

Given the following JIRA issue and its context, classify whether the code changes it performed are
one of:
 - Catalog CRUD: Consumes the catalog as a reader only, but doesn't actually perform catalog changes
 - Catalog DDL: Consumes the catalog as a reader and writer, performs catalog changes
 - Catalog Implementation Change: Changes the code or the API of the catalog implementation
 - Something Else: Doesn't meet any of the criteria above
Provide 2-3 sentences justification.

**JIRA issue**
Issue: {issue_key}
Summary: {issue_summary}
Description: {issue_description}

**Commit diffs**
{commit_diffs}

**Classification Criteria:**

An issue is "Catalog CRUD" if one or more of the following apply:
 - Reads from the local catalog containers (e.g. `CollectionCatalog`, `AutoGet*`, `CatalogCache`, `acquireCollection*`, etc.)
 - Reads from the global catalog containers (e.g., `DatabaseShardingState`, `CollectionShardingState`, `ShardingState`)
 - Reads catalog metadata (UUIDs, namespaces, collection properties)
 - Reads directly from the durable catalog (`_mdb_catalog` or the `config.cache.databases/collections/chunks` collections)
 - Performs collection/database locking for read (S or IS mode)

An issue is "Catalog DDL" if one or more of the following apply:
 - Modifies files in `src/mongo/db/s/` (weak signal, but often true)
 - Writes to the the durable catalog (`_mdb_catalog` or the `config.cache.databases/collections/chunks` collections)
 - Modifies the local catalog containers (e.g. `CollectionCatalog`)
 - Modifies the global catalog containers (e.g., `DatabaseShardingState/Runtime`, `CollectionShardingState/Runtime`, `ShardingState/Runtime`)
 - Modifies catalog metadata (UUIDs, namespaces, collection properties)
 - Calls to `CollectionCatalog::write()`, `establishConsistentCollection()`
 - Performs collection/database locking for write (X mode)

An issue is "Catalog Implementation Change" if one or more of the following apply:
 - Modifies files in `src/mongo/s` (weak signal, but often true)
 - Modifies files in `src/mongo/db/s/` (weak signal, but often true)
 - Modifies catalog interfaces (CollectionCatalog, MDBCatalog, or durable_catalog)
 - Modifies DDL coordinator classes or DDL command implementations
 - Observes oplog entries for catalog changes via ShardServerOpObserver or ConfigServerOpObserver
 - Modifies catalog cache interfaces (CatalogCache, ShardServerCatalogCacheLoader)

**Output Format:**  
Classification: [Catalog CRUD | Catalog DDL | Catalog Implementation Change | Something Else]

Reasoning: [2-3 sentences explaining why, citing specific files, functions, or patterns from the diff]
